<h2>ACT I</h2>

<h3>SCENE I.  Venice. A street.</h3>
<p><i>Enter RODERIGO and IAGO</i></p>

<table><tr><td valign="top" width="210px"><b>RODERIGO</b></td>
<td>Tush! never tell me; I take it much unkindly<br />
That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse<br />
As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.</td></tr></table>

<table><tr><td valign="top" width="210px"><b>IAGO</b></td>
<td>'Sblood, but you will not hear me:<br />
If ever I did dream of such a matter, Abhor me.</td></tr></table>

<table><tr><td valign="top" width="210px"><b>RODERIGO</b></td>
<td>Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.</td></tr></table>

<table><tr><td valign="top" width="210px"><b>IAGO</b></td>
<td>Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city,<br />
In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,<br />
Off-capp'd to him: and, by the faith of man,<br />
I know my price, I am worth no worse a place:<br />
But he; as loving his own pride and purposes,<br />
Evades them, with a bombast circumstance<br />
Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war;<br />
And, in conclusion,<br />
Nonsuits my mediators; for, 'Certes,' says he,<br />
'I have already chose my officer.'<br />
And what was he?<br />
Forsooth, a great arithmetician,<br />
One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,<br />
A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife;<br />
That never set a squadron in the field,<br />
Nor the division of a battle knows<br />
More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,<br />
Wherein the toged consuls can propose<br />
As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise,<br />
Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election:<br />
And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof<br />
At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds<br />
Christian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'd<br />
By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,<br />
He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,<br />
And I--God bless the mark!--his Moorship's ancient.</td></tr></table>

<table><tr><td valign="top" width="210px"><b>RODERIGO</b></td>
<td>By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.</td></tr></table>

<table><tr><td valign="top" width="210px"><b>IAGO</b></td>
<td>Why, there's no remedy; 'tis the curse of service,<br />
Preferment goes by letter and affection,<br />
And not by old gradation, where each second<br />
Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself,<br />
Whether I in any just term am affined<br />
To love the Moor.</td></tr></table>

<table><tr><td valign="top" width="210px"><b>RODERIGO</b></td>
<td>I would not follow him then.</td></tr></table>

<table><tr><td valign="top" width="210px"><b>IAGO</b></td>
<td>O, sir, content you;<br />
I follow him to serve my turn upon him:<br />
We cannot all be masters, nor all masters<br />
Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark<br />
Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,<br />
That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,<br />
Wears out his time, much like his master's ass,<br />
For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd:<br />
Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are<br />
Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty,<br />
Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,<br />
And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,<br />
Do well thrive by them and when they have lined<br />
their coats<br />
Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul;<br />
And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,<br />
It is as sure as you are Roderigo,<br />
Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:<br />
In following him, I follow but myself;<br />
Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,<br />
But seeming so, for my peculiar end:<br />
For when my outward action doth demonstrate<br />
The native act and figure of my heart<br />
In compliment extern, 'tis not long after<br />
But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve<br />
For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.</td></tr></table>

If he can carry't thus!</td></tr></table>

<table><tr><td valign="top" width="210px"><b>IAGO</b></td>
<td>Call up her father,<br />
Rouse him: make after him, poison his delight,<br />
Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,<br />
And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,<br />
Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,<br />
Yet throw such changes of vexation on't,<br />
As it may lose some colour.</td></tr></table>

As when, by night and negligence, the fire<br />
Is spied in populous cities.</td></tr></table>

your gown;<br />
Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;<br />
Even now, now, very now, an old black ram<br />
Is topping your white ewe. Arise, arise;<br />
Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,<br />
Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you:<br />
Arise, I say.</td></tr></table>

Being full of supper and distempering draughts,<br />
Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come<br />
To start my quiet.</td></tr></table>

My spirit and my place have in them power<br />
To make this bitter to thee.</td></tr></table>

My house is not a grange.</td></tr></table>

In simple and pure soul I come to you.</td></tr></table>

<td>'Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not<br />
serve God, if the devil bid you. Because we come to<br />
do you service and you think we are ruffians, you'll<br />
have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse;<br />
you'll have your nephews neigh to you; you'll have<br />
coursers for cousins and gennets for germans.</td></tr></table>

<td>Sir, I will answer any thing. But, I beseech you,<br />
If't be your pleasure and most wise consent,<br />
As partly I find it is, that your fair daughter,<br />
At this odd-even and dull watch o' the night,<br />
Transported, with no worse nor better guard<br />
But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,<br />
To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor--<br />
If this be known to you and your allowance,<br />
We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs;<br />
But if you know not this, my manners tell me<br />
We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe<br />
That, from the sense of all civility,<br />
I thus would play and trifle with your reverence:<br />
Your daughter, if you have not given her leave,<br />
I say again, hath made a gross revolt;<br />
Tying her duty, beauty, wit and fortunes<br />
In an extravagant and wheeling stranger<br />
Of here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself:<br />
If she be in her chamber or your house,<br />
Let loose on me the justice of the state<br />
For thus deluding you.</td></tr></table>

Give me a taper! call up all my people!<br />
This accident is not unlike my dream:<br />
Belief of it oppresses me already.<br />
Light, I say! light!</td></tr></table>

It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place,<br />
To be produced--as, if I stay, I shall--<br />
Against the Moor: for, I do know, the state,<br />
However this may gall him with some cheque,<br />
Cannot with safety cast him, for he's embark'd<br />
With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,<br />
Which even now stand in act, that, for their souls,<br />
Another of his fathom they have none,<br />
To lead their business: in which regard,<br />
Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains.<br />
Yet, for necessity of present life,<br />
I must show out a flag and sign of love,<br />
Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,<br />
Lead to the Sagittary the raised search;<br />
And there will I be with him. So, farewell.</td></tr></table>

And what's to come of my despised time<br />
Is nought but bitterness. Now, Roderigo,<br />
Where didst thou see her? O unhappy girl!<br />
With the Moor, say'st thou? Who would be a father!<br />
How didst thou know 'twas she? O she deceives me<br />
Past thought! What said she to you? Get more tapers:<br />
Raise all my kindred. Are they married, think you?</td></tr></table>

Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters' minds<br />

By which the property of youth and maidhood<br />
May be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo,<br />
Of some such thing?</td></tr></table>

Some one way, some another. Do you know<br />
Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?</td></tr></table>

On, good Roderigo: I'll deserve your pains.</td></tr></table>

Are you fast married? Be assured of this,<br />

Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom<br />
Of such a thing as thou, to fear, not to delight.<br />

That my youth suffer'd. My story being done,<br />
She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:<br />
She swore, in faith, twas strange, 'twas passing strange,<br />
'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful:<br />
She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd<br />
That heaven had made her such a man: she thank'd me,<br />
And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,<br />
I should but teach him how to tell my story.<br />
And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:<br />
She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd,<br />

thou canst: if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt<br />
an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian not<br />
